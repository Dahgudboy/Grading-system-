## README: School Grading System  

### Overview  
This project is a simple school grading system that allows students to input their names and scores to check their corresponding grades. The system assigns grades based on pre-defined scoring criteria and displays the results.  

### Features  
1. **Student Input**:  
   - Students can enter their names and scores.  
   - The system validates the input to ensure the score is a valid number within the allowed range (0-100).  

2. **Grade Calculation**:  
   - Grades are assigned based on the following criteria:  
     - **90-100**: A  
     - **80-89**: B  
     - **70-79**: C  
     - **60-69**: D  
     - **0-59**: F  

3. **Result Display**:  
   - After inputting their score, students see their name, score, and corresponding grade.  

4. **Error Handling**:  
   - The system prompts the user to correct invalid input, such as scores outside the 0-100 range or non-numeric entries.  

### Requirements  
- **Programming Language**: Python (or another language based on preference).  
- No additional libraries are required for basic functionality.  

### Installation

3. Enter your score (0-100).  
4. View your grade on the screen.  
5. Repeat for additional students or exit the program.  

### Example Interaction  
```  
Enter your name: John  
Enter your score: 85  
Hello, John! Your score is 85. Your grade is: B.

Invalid score. Please enter a number between 0 and 100.  
```  

### Customization  
1. **Grade Criteria**:  
   - You can modify the grading criteria by adjusting the conditions in the program code.  

2. **User Interface**:  
   - Enhance the program by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web-based interface.
